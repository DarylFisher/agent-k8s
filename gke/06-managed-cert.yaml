# Google-managed SSL Certificate
#
# This creates a free SSL certificate managed by Google.
# The certificate will auto-provision once:
# 1. DNS is configured to point to the load balancer IP
# 2. The ingress is created and healthy
#
# Provisioning can take 15-60 minutes after DNS is configured.
# Check status: kubectl describe managedcertificate scheduler-cert -n agent-scheduler
